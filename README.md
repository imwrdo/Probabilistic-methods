## About

Welcome to the Probabilistic Methods University Course Repository!
This repository contains completed labs for the Probabilistic Methods course at my University. This repository serves as a collection of completed labs for the Probabilistic Methods course. Each lab explores various topics related to probabilistic methods, providing hands-on experience and practical knowledge. The labs are designed to deepen understanding and proficiency in probabilistic concepts and their applications

## Labs Description
1. Basic Combinatorial Issues
  - Folder: Lab_1
  - Status: Completed and Published
  - Description: This lab focuses on fundamental combinatorial issues such as permutations, combinations, and counting principles. Implemented in Python language, it offers practical exercises to grasp these foundational concepts in probabilistic methods.
2. Random number generators with uniform distribution 
  - Folder: Lab_2
  - Status: Completed and Published
  - Description: This lab delves into random number generators with a uniform distribution. Through Python implementations, students explore various methods of generating random numbers with uniform distribution and analyze their properties. This lab provides insights into the importance and applications of random number generation in probabilistic modeling.
3. Random number generators with arbitrary distribution 
  - Folder: Lab_3
  - Status: Completed and Published
  - Description:  This lab delves into random number generators with using inverse distribution method
